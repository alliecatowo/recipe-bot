# Instagram Recipe Scraper

**Instagram Recipe Scraper** is a Python-based tool that extracts actionable recipes from Instagram posts. By analyzing captions and video audio transcripts, it generates well-structured recipes in Markdown format. I intend to scale this up to a full-fledged web application in the future, but for now, it's a command-line tool MVP.

This project uses:
- [Instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io) to download Instagram posts.
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) for audio extraction.
- [Pydub](https://pydub.com) for audio processing.
- [Whisper API](https://openai.com/whisper) for audio transcription.
- [OpenAI GPT](https://openai.com/api) to generate the recipe from text inputs.
